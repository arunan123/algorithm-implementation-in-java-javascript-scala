# Algorithms-and-datastructures-implementation-in-java-javascript-scala-python-kotlin
The Aim of this project is to provide a collection of reusable Algorithms which can be used effectively in different scenarios.

As of now the languages supported are,
1. Java
2. Python
3. JavaScript
4. Scala
5. Kotlin

As of now most of the implementations are in Java, Python and Javascript. Need Kotlin and scala developers.

If you want to add more languages please message me.

# Features
1. Reusable codes
2. Tested the Algorithm implementations with different set of datas and provided the statistics in the header comment, so that developers can choose and reuse the algorithm which solve their business problem

This project is Migrated from sourceforge. It is a 12 Year old project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/algorithmdb/)
