# algorithmdb
The Aim of this project is to provide a collection of reusable Algorithms which can be used effectively in different scenarios.  Algorithm implementations are in Java. Objective here is to implement algorithms which should be more efficient than the JDK implementation and also to create a platform for the researchers who works on Data Mining, Encryption algorithms, ect.. to collaborate and contribute to this project.

# Features
1. Reusable codes
2. Tested the Algorithm implementations with different set of datas and provided the statistics in the header comment, so that developers can choose and reuse the algorithm which solve their business problem

This project is Migrated from sourceforge. It is 7 Year old project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/algorithmdb/)

# For Developers who want to contribute to the project

# Software Prerequisites 
1. GIT client 
2. JDK8
3. JUnit 4
4. An IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea)

# Knowledge Prerequisites
1. Sound knowledge in Core Java and OOPS
2. Knowledge about writing JUnit test cases
3. Familiarity with GIT

# For Every Java Implementation, follow this format:

Also add a comment in the header which describes the algorithm and also add the performance details of your implementation in the following format, e.g.
::

    Algorithm Definition:
    Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm, which will steep through a list of elements and compares two elements and swaps      them if they are not in order, until no further swaps needed.

    Performance Review:

    This implementation has tested with the following data
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Input     | Time taken in Milliseconds |Time taken in Nanoseconds
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Sequence   | 10 ms                      | 1200 ns
        numbers    |                            |
        from       |                            |
        1 to 10000 |                            |

If you are Implementing a Data Structure, please describe it and add the complexity for all operations.

Example, ::

     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * This is an implementation of a doubly linked list where it stores the 
     * elements in the Natural sorted order. Class didn't implement the List 
     * interface, since the elements inserted should be comparable
     * 
     * Adding an element    : Linear
     * Remove Max element   : Linear
     * Size of the LL       : Constant
     * Peek for Max element : Constant
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Write descriptive comment of your implementation.
2. If you are writing an algorithm, Implement the marker interface "Algorithm" in your implementation
3. Implement the appropriate Existing interface in your implementation, if available.
4. Add your Algorithm implementation in an appropriate category i.e. Appropriate package. If your algorithm category doesnâ€™t exists then create a package for that.
E.g. If you write a compression algorithm then create a package,
         com.algorithmdb.algorithms.compression inside the src folder;
        For writing the test case for the same algorithm create a package,
         com.algorithmdb.algorithms.compression.test inside the test folder
5. Write JUNIT Test Case for your implementations and add that class in the appropriate package. While committing the source code, please commit both implementation and test cases.
6. Please dont commit incomplete implementations. Commit only working code.
